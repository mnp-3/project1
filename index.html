          About the Series
        </h2>
        <p>
          Written by <a href="https://www.jessahastings.com/" target="_blank">Jessa Hastings</a>, the Magnolia Parks books follow the glamorous, messy, and heart-wrenching
          lives of London&apos;s elite. It is a contemporary romance series full of love, heartbreak, betrayal, and unforgettable
          characters, this series captures readers with every page. The narrative is divided into two primary stortlines
          between Magnolia Parks and Daisy Haites. 
        </p>
        <h2>
          Why I Love the Series
        </h2>
        <p>
          The main reason I love the series is because of the writing style. Jessa Hastings masterfully balances
          the glamour and intrigue of high society with the raw, emotional reality of human relationships. 
          As I was reading the series I quickly forgot that these were fictional characters, that is how immersive the writing is. 
          There are both tender and heart-wrenching moments that have stuck with me, even now I still randomly think of this series having read it almost a year ago. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, what I love most is how authentic the relationships in the series feel.
