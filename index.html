        <h2>
          Why I Love the Series
        </h2>
        <p>
          The main reason I love the series is because of the writing style. Jessa Hastings masterfully balances
          the glamour and intrigue of high society with the raw, emotional reality of human relationships. 
          As I was reading the series I quickly forgot that these were fictional characters, that is how immersive the writing is. 
          There are both tender and heart-wrenching moments that have stuck with me. Even now, almost a year after reading it, I still find myself randomly thinking about this series.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, what I love most is how authentic the relationships in the series feel. Most of the charcters are flawed but that is what makes them so relatable. 
          Their heartbreaks and mistakes, mirror real life in a way that it feel both comforting and devastating at the same time. I love the world-building,
          from the glamorous settings to intimate moments, every detail pulls you in so completely that it feels like you’re right there with them, experiencing their joys and struggles.
          It’s rare for a series to make me feel this way, which is why these stories will always hold such a special place in my heart. ♡
